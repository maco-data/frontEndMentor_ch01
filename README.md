## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Importing fonts directly on CSS

```css
import url('link');
```

Setting variables in CSS

```ccs
::root {
    --var1: parameters;
    --var2: parameters;
}
```

I learned a lot about the use of Grid and Flex as well as how to format my layouts according to a screen size.

### Continued development

I would like to develop more using Flex and Grid.
