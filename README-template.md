### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

Importing fonts directly on CSS

```css
import url('link');
```

Setting variables in CSS

```ccs
::root {
    --var1: parameters;
    --var2: parameters;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to develop more using Flex and Grid.
